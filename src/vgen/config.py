# Default problem that will be used if no custom problem is provided
DEFAULT_PROBLEM = """Please act as a professional verilog designer.

Implement a 16-bit divider module, the dividend is 16-bit and the divider is 8-bit in combinational logic. Extract the higher bits of the dividend, matching the bit width of the divisor. Compare these bits with the divisor: if the dividend bits are greater, set the quotient to 1, otherwise set it to 0, and use the difference as the remainder. Concatenate the remainder with the highest remaining 1-bit of the dividend, and repeat the process until all dividend bits are processed.

Module name:
    div_16bit

Input ports:
    A: 16-bit dividend.
    B: 8-bit divisor.

Output ports:
    result: 16-bit quotient.
    odd: 16-bit remainder.

Implementation:
The module uses two always blocks to perform the division operation.
The first always block is a combinational block triggered by any change in the input values A and B. It updates the values of two registers, a_reg and b_reg, with the values of A and B, respectively.
The second always block is also a combinational block triggered by any change in the input values A and B.

Give me the complete code.
